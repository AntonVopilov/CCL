\title{Core Cosmology Library: Precision Cosmological Predictions for LSST}

\maketitlepre

\begin{abstract}

The Core Cosmology Library (\ccl) provides routines to compute basic cosmological observables with validated numerical accuracy. These routines have been validated to an accuracy level, documented here, against the results of the Code Comparison Project. In the current version, predictions are provided for distances and background quantities, angular auto- and cross-spectra of cosmic shear and clustering, and the halo mass function. Fiducial specifications for the expected LSST galaxy distributions and clustering bias are also included, together with the capability of computing redshift distributions for a user-defined photometric redshift model. \ccl is written in C, with a Python interface.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\vol{Mustapha Ishak}

Tentative: An era of precision cosmology is at the door with the advent of a number of high precision surveys. One of them is the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) that is designed to address the question of cosmic acceleration and the Dark Energy associated with it.  

In preparation for constraining cosmology with LSST, it is necessary to be able to produce rigorous (and accurate?) theoretical predictions for the cosmological quantities that will be measured. The Core Cosmology Library\footnote{\url{https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL}} (\ccl) aims to provide, in one library, a way of making predictions that are validated to a well-documented numerical accuracy, for the purpose of constraining cosmology with LSST. By constructing a cosmology library specifically with LSST and its Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) in mind, it is possible to ensure that it is flexible, adaptable, and validated for all cases of interest, as well as user-friendly and appropriate for the needs of all DESC working groups.

\ccl computes basic cosmological functions including the Hubble parameter, distances, density parameters, and linear growth functions. It calculates the matter power spectrum using various methods including common approximations, calls to external software such as {\tt CLASS} \citep{class}, or emulators such as the ``Cosmic Emulator'' of \citet{Lawrence17}. It computes 2-point angular power spectra and correlation functions from various probes, going beyond the Limber approximation. \ccl 's overall structure is illustrated in figure \damonge{missing figure}.%\ref{fig:CCC_structure}. 

\ccl 's implementation includes spatially flat and curved $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmologies, and $w$CDM cosmologies with the option of using a time-dependent equation of state. It also allows the use of massive neutrinos. (is Table 1 up to date?). 

Finally, it is worth noting that while \ccl is built in light of LSST, its flexible and modular structure is designed to work with any other pipelines and surveys.

\section{Cosmological models and observables}
\vol{Renee}

The overarching goal of \ccl is to allow seamless integration of different cosmological models of interest to LSST, given some priors on the range of validity of the specific models.

The cosmological components include the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$, the dark energy density $\Omega_\Lambda$, the radiation density $\Omega_r$, the curvature density $\Omega_K$,
the neutrino density of both massless and massive neutrinos, given by $\Omega_{\nu, {\rm rel}}$ and $\Omega_{\nu, {\rm m}}$ respectively, the optical depth $\tau$, and parameters for the equation of state of dark energy.

Currently, the following families of models are supported:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with parameters $\Omega_b$, $n_s$, $A_s$ or $\sigma_8$, $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_\Lambda$, $\tau$ and a cosmological constant dark energy model with 
 equation-of-state $w=-1$.
 \item $w$CDM and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model for dark energy and it's redshift dependence ($w(a) = w_0+w_a(1-a)$, \citealt{Chevallier01} and \citealt{Linder03})
 \item A universe with non-zero curvature ($K$) so that the curvature energy density (density parameter (MI)) is the difference of sum of the energy densities of the other components with respect to unity (flatness), i.e. $\Omega_k = 1- \sum_i \Omega_i$.
 \item All of the above, plus an arbitrary, user-defined modified growth function (see description in Section \ref{sec:growth}).
  \item Massive neutrino species in combination with any of the above except the user-defined modified growth function, specified by either $\Sigma m_\nu$ (which maps on to the density $\Omega_{\nu, {\rm m}}$ above), or by the individual masses of each of three neutrino species.
\end{itemize}

In the particular case of cosmologies with massive neutrinos, \ccl allows the user to specify either a sum of masses, $\Sigma m_\nu$, or the individual mass of each of three neutrino species. In the former case, \ccl will by default split $\Sigma m_\nu$ into three neutrino masses which are consistent with the normal hierarchy (see, e.g. \cite{Gerbino2017} for a review). However, the user can alternatively ask for $\Sigma m_\nu$ to be split either into masses consistent with the inverted hierarchy, or into equal masses. Each mass is then checked for whether it is non-relativistic (massive) at $z=0$, and this information is used in combination with the user-provided value of $N_{\rm eff}$ (the effective number of relativistic neutrino species in the early universe) to set the number of relativistic neutrino species.

%\todo{Range of validity of the predictions.}
Not all features of \ccl are available for all models. For a guide to which predictions are available for each model, see Table \ref{tab:cosmo}. Note that if users install their own version of {\tt CLASS}, {\tt CCL} can then make predictions for a more extended set of cosmologies. Users should take care to understand the validity of the {\tt CCL} assumptions for their own models.

\subsection{Background cosmology}
\vol{Renee}

\vol{Shahab -- added some extra text on physical densities, along with various minor corrections. Moreover, what we expressed as $\Omega_{\nu, {\rm m}}(a)$ in Eqns 1 and 2 should be re-expressed as either $\rho^{-1}_{\rm crit,0} \rho_{\nu, {\rm m}}(a)$ or $H_0^{-2} H^{2}(a)\Omega_{\nu, {\rm m}}(a)$ given the definition of $\Omega_X(a)$.}

\cont{Background cosmology parameter definition. Expansion and distance functions. Growth function and growth rate.}

The models that are specified above map directly onto cosmological observables such as the expansion rate of the Universe, which is parameterized through the Hubble parameter as
\begin{align}\label{eq:Ha}
\frac{H(a)}{H_0} &= a^{-3/2}\Big(\Omega_{M,0}+\Omega_{\Lambda,0} a^{-3(w_0+w_a)}
    \exp[3 w_a (a-1)]+\nonumber \\ &\Omega_{K,0} a +(\Omega_{g,0} + \Omega_{\nu, {\rm rel},0}) a^{-1} + \rho^{-1}_{\rm crit,0} \rho_{\nu, {\rm m}}(a)a^3\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}} ,
\end{align}
where we have assumed the CPL parameterization described above, and
$\rho^{-1}_{\rm crit,0} \rho_{\nu, {\rm m}}(a)$ is the fractional energy density of massive neutrinos, calculated via
\begin{align}
\rho^{-1}_{\rm crit,0} \rho_{\nu, {\rm m}}(a) &= \sum_{i=1}^{N_\nu} \frac{8 \pi^2(\pi k_B )^3 k_B}{15(c h_{\rm P})^3} \frac{8 \pi G}{3c^2H_0^2} \left(\frac{T_{\nu}^{\rm eff}}{a}\right)^4 \nonumber \\ & \times \left(\frac{7}{8}\int_0^{\infty} dx \, x^2 \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + \left(\mu^i\right)^2}}{\exp(x) + 1}\right).
\label{Omnu}
\end{align}
Here, $h_{\rm P}$ is Planck's constant, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $G$ is Newton's constant, Hubble's constant $H_0 = 100~h~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ is expressed in terms of the dimensionless constant $h$, $c$ is the speed of massless particles, and $T_{\nu}^{\rm eff}$ is the present effective temperature of the massive neutrinos. $T_{\nu}^{\rm eff}$ is related to the temperature of the CMB via $T_{\nu}^{\rm eff} = T_{\rm CMB} T_{\rm NCDM}$, where $T_{\rm NCDM}$ is a dimensionless factor ($\simeq1$) used by e.g. {\tt CLASS} to set the ratio ${\sum m_\nu}/{\Omega_{\nu}^0}$ to its experimentally measured value. Note that $T_{\rm NCDM}$ is used to modulate the effective temperature of massive neutrinos only; the temperature of relativistic neutrinos follows the usual relation. Finally, $\mu^i$ is a per-species mass-dependent dimensionless constant, given by $\mu^i = m_{\nu}^{i}c^2 a / (k_B T_{\nu}^{\rm eff})$.

The density parameters $\Omega_X(a)$ of a given species $X$ are defined in terms of the physical densities $\rho_X(a)$ via $\Omega_X(a) \equiv \rho^{-1}_{\rm crit}(a) \rho_X(a)$, where the critical density $\rho_{\rm crit}(a) = {( 8 \pi G)}^{-1} 3H^2(a) = \rho_{\rm crit,0} H_0^{-2} H^2(a)$. As an example, the physical density of matter is given by $\rho_M(a) = \rho_{M,0} a^{-3} = \rho_{\rm crit,0} \Omega_{M,0} a^{-3}$, and its density parameter is $\Omega_M(a) = \Omega_{M,0} H_0^{2} a^{-3} H^{-2}(a)$. \ccl moreover allows for comoving physical densities $\rho_{X, {\rm com}}(a) = \rho_X(a) a^3$ to be extracted, which in the case of matter reduces to $\rho_{M, {\rm com}} = \rho_{\rm crit,0} \Omega_{M,0}$.

%\noindent
In order to compute distances, we consider the comoving radial distance, which is calculated via a numerical integral as
\begin{equation}
 \chi(a)= c \int_a^1 \frac{da'}{a'^2 H(a')}.
\end{equation}
%\noindent
%The comoving transverse distance
The comoving angular diameter distance
is then computed in terms of the comoving radial distance,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:angdist}
 r(\chi)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
                 k^{-1/2}\sin(k^{1/2}\chi) & k>0\\
                 \chi & k=0\\
                 |k|^{-1/2}\sinh(|k|^{1/2}\chi) & k<0\\
                \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
where $k = \left({\sum_X \Omega_X -1}\right) c^{-2} H_0^2$ is the curvature.
%\noindent
This function can be written directly in terms of the present curvature density parameter, $\Omega_{K,0}$, as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:angdist_omegak}
 r(\chi) = \sqrt{\Omega_{K,0}}\sinh(\sqrt{\Omega_{K,0}}\chi),
\end{equation}
which is valid for all forms of the curvature density.
The angular diameter distance is given by $d_A=a\,r(a)$, and the luminosity distance is
$d_L=r(a)/a,$ leading to the familiar relation $d_A = a^2d_L$ which is valid in general for all metric theories of gravity.
The \ccl suite also has the functionality to compute the distance modulus, defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:distmod}
    \mu = 5 \log_{10}(d_L / {\rm pc})-5,
\end{equation}
along with $a(\chi)$, the inverse function of $\chi(a)$.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Growth of perturbations}
\vol{Mustapha Ishak}
\label{sec:growth}

To compute the linear growth factor of matter perturbations, $D(a)$, \ccl solves the following usual differential equation:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{da}\left(a^3H(a)\frac{dD}{da}\right)=\frac{3}{2}\Omega_M(a)aH(a)D,
\end{equation}
using a Runge-Kutta Cash-Karp algorithm. 

In doing this, \ccl simultaneously computes the logarithmic growth rate $f(a)$, defined as:
\begin{equation}
  f(a)=\frac{d\ln D}{d\ln a}.
\end{equation}

\ccl provides different functions that return the growth normalized to $D(a=1)=1$ and to $D(a\ll1)\rightarrow a$. It employs an accelerated spline that is linearly spaced in the scale factor to interpolate the growth functions. 

The growth calculations cover flat and curved $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $(w_0 + w_a)$CDM cosmologies. However, it should be noted that the above treatment is strictly valid for a Universe containing only dust-like matter components. A scale-independent growth rate is, for example, ill-defined in the presence of massive neutrinos which are not included in \ccl 's growth calculation. 

Finally, \ccl allows for an alternative `modified gravity' cosmological model defined by a regular background $(w_0+w_a)$CDM (\todo{with arbitrary $K$?}) as well as a user-defined $\Delta f(a)$, such that the true growth rate in this model is given by $f(a)=f_0(a)+\Delta f(a)$, where $f_0(a)$ is the growth rate in the background model. Note that this model is only consistently implemented with regards to the computation of the linear growth factor and growth rates (which will also scale the linear power spectrum). All other \ccl functions (including the non-linear power spectrum) will ignore these modifications. This model, and the interpretation of the predictions given by \ccl, should therefore be used with care.\todo{What is the mapping between $\Delta f(a)$ and MG theories?}

\subsection{Matter power spectrum}
\vol{Elisa Chisari}

\cont{Matter power spectrum and transfer function definition. Approximations. Cosmic emulator. Baryonic physics model.}

Theoretical predictions for cosmological observables such as galaxy clustering, gravitational lensing and cluster mass functions rely on knowledge of the distribution of matter from small to large scales in the Universe. The quantity most frequently used to describe the distribution of matter at a given wavenumber and redshift is the matter power spectrum, $P(k,z)$, defined as
\begin{equation}
  \langle \tilde\delta({\bf k},z)\tilde\delta({\bf k}^\prime,z)\rangle = (2\pi)^3P(k,z)\
\delta_D^3({\bf k}-{\bf k}')
\end{equation}
where $\tilde\delta({\bf k})$ is the Fourier component of the overdensity field at a given wavenumber and $\delta_D^3$ is the Dirac delta function. $P(k,z)$ has units of volume and a dimensionless analogue is often defined as
\begin{equation}
  \Delta^2(k,z) \equiv \frac{k^3}{2\pi^2}P(k,z).
\end{equation}

\ccl implements several different methods for making predictions for the matter power spectrum. Two of those methods, the BBKS \citep{BBKS} and \citet{1998ApJ...496..605E} approximations are only accurate to within a few percent and are implemented for validation purposes only. These approximations provide analytical expressions for the transfer function, $T(k)$, which is related to the matter power spectrum by $\Delta(k)^2 \propto T^2(k) k^{3+n_s}$, where $n_s$. The normalization of the power spectrum is defined at $z=0$ by setting $\sigma_8$ to its value today.

The default \ccl implementation uses the {\tt CLASS} algorithm \citet{class} to obtain predictions for $P(k,z)$. In addition, \ccl can also generate $P(k,z)$ predictions by emulation of cosmological numerical simuations, in particular, using the ``Cosmic Emulator'' developed by \citet{Lawrence17}. 

None of the previous methods account for the impact of baryonic physics on the distribution of matter, which is known to exceed percent level at scales $k \gtrsim 1/$Mpc \citep{vanDaalen11,Illustris,Hellwing16,Springel17} and can affect the extraction of cosmological parameters \citep{Semboloni11,Semboloni13,Mohammed14,Eifler15,Mohammed17}. To account for this effect, we incorporate in \ccl an effective parametrisation \citep{Schneider15} of the redistribution of matter as a consequence of feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei and adiabatic cooling. This parametrisation reproduces results from the OWLS~\citep{vanDaalen11} simulations at $z=0$. We give an overview of each method in what follows.

{\bf BBKS approximation}. \ccl implements the analytical BBKS approximation to the transfer function \citep{BBKS}, given by
\begin{eqnarray}
  T&&(q\equiv k/\Gamma h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}) = \frac{\ln[1+2.34q]}{2.34q}\times\\
  &&[1+3.89q+(16.2q)^2+(5.47q)^3+(6.71q)^4]^{-0.25}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Gamma = \Omega_m h$. The BBKS power spectrum option is primarily used as a precisely-defined input for testing the numerical accuracy of \ccl routines (as described in Sec.~\damonge{missing section}),%\ref{sec:tests}),
and it is not recommended for other uses.

{\bf Eisenstein \& Hu approximation}. \ccl also provides an approximation to the matter power spectrum as implemented by \citet{1998ApJ...496..605E} (we refer the reader to this paper for a detailed discussion of the fitting formulae).\footnote{Note that the implementation in \ccl modifies Eq. 5 of \citet{1998ApJ...496..605E} using $a^{-1}=1+z$ instead of the approximation $a^{-1}\sim z$. The difference in the resulting power spectra is negligible, but larger than 1 part in $10^4$ for $k<10\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.}

{\bf \tt CLASS.} The default configuration of \ccl adopts predictions for the nonlinear matter power spectrum from this publicly available software \citep{class}. {\tt CLASS} currently computes the non-linear power spectrum using the HaloFit prescription of \cite{CLASS_halofit}.

{\bf Cosmic emulator.} The emulator \citep{Lawrence17} provides accurate predictions for the nonlinear matter power spectrum, at the $1\%$ level for $z\leq 2$ and in the wavenumber range $k=[10^{-3},5]$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The allowed range of cosmological parameters that can be passed to the emulator is as follows:
 \begin{eqnarray}
 0.12&\leq& \Omega_m h^2 \leq 0.155,\nonumber\\
 0.0215&\leq& \Omega_b h^2 \leq 0.0235,\nonumber\\
 0.7&\leq& \sigma_8 \leq 0.9,\nonumber\\
 0.55&\leq& h \leq 0.85,\nonumber\\
 0.85&\leq& n_s\leq 1.05,\nonumber\\
 -1.3&\leq& w_0\leq-0.7,\nonumber\\
 -1.73&\leq& w_a\leq -0.7,\footnote{Actually, $w_a$ and $w_0$ are constrained jointly to be $0.3\leq (-w_0-w_a)^{1/4}$.}\nonumber\\
 0.0&\leq& \Omega_\nu h^2 \leq 0.01.\footnote{ While massive neutrinos can be passed to the cosmic emulator through \ccl, this particular feature has not yet been validated.}
 \end{eqnarray}

 {\bf Baryonic correction model (BCM).} \ccl incorporates the impact of baryons on the total matter power spectrum via the BCM of \citet{Schneider15}. The main consequences of baryonic processes are: to suppress the power spectrum at intermediate scales ($k\sim$ a few $h/$Mpc) due to the ejection of gas by Active Galactic Nuclei feedback, and to enhance it at smaller scales due to adiabatic cooling. To account for these effects, BCM uses an effective decomposition for the impact of gas ejection ($G$) and the enhancement of the small scale profile due to star formation ($S$) to estimate the fractional effect of baryonic processes on the dark matter-only power spectrum ($P_{\rm DMO}$):
\begin{equation}
  P_{\rm BCM}(k,z)=P_{\rm DMO}(k,z) G(k|M_c,\eta_b,z)S(k|k_s)
\end{equation}
Three effective parameters govern the contribution of baryonic processes to modifying the total matter power spectrum:
 \begin{itemize}
   \item $\log_{10} [M_c/($M$_\odot/h)]$: the mass of the clusters responsible for feedback, which regulates the amount of suppression of the matter power spectrum at intermediate scales;
   \item $\eta_b$: a dimensionless parameter which determines the scale at which suppression peaks;
   \item and $k_s$ [$h/$Mpc]: the wavenumber that determines the scale of the stellar profile.
 \end{itemize}
 If these parameters are not specified by the user, \ccl assumes the default parameters of \citet{Schneider15}, which are in agreement with results from OWLS.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{2-point correlators}
\vol{David Alonso, Tom McClintock}

\cont{Kernels. Correlation functions. Nuisance parameters and functions.}

This section describes the theoretical expectations for the two-point correlators of pairs of quantities (fields) defined on the sky. These fields can be classified in terms of their spin $s$ under rotations on the plane tangent to the sphere. In general a spin-$s$ field is defined by two real-valued functions of the spherical coordinates $a_1(\nv)$ and $a_2(\nv)$ (e.g. $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ for weak lensing or the Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ in the case of polarized intensity), from which one can form the complex field $a=a_1+ia_2$.

Spin-$s$ quantities can be decomposed into their harmonic coefficients $\,_sa_{\ell m}$ through a spherical harmonic transfom:
\begin{equation}\nonumber
  \,_sa_{\ell m}=\int d\nv\,a(\nv)\,_sY^*_{\ell m}(\nv),\hspace{12pt}
  a(\nv)=\sum_{\ell m}\,_sa_{\ell m}\,Y_{\ell m}(\nv)
\end{equation}
where $_sY_{\ell m}$ are the spin-weighed spherical harmonics. The harmonic coefficients can then be associated with parity-even and parity-odd components ($E$-modes and $B$-modes respectively) as\footnote{We note that for spin-$0$ quantities the minus sign preceding these equations is usually omitted.}
\begin{align}\nonumber
   E_{\ell m}&=-\frac{1}{2}\left[\,_{s}a_{\ell m}+(-1)^s\,_{-s}a_{\ell m}\right]\\\nonumber
  iB_{\ell m}&=-\frac{1}{2}\left[\,_{s}a_{\ell m}-(-1)^s\,_{-s}a_{\ell m}\right]
\end{align}

In what follows we will focus on scalar ($s=0$) quantities such as the overdensity of source number counts or the lensing convergence, and on spin-2 fields such as the lensing shear. We will also distinguish between {\sl tracers} (fields observed on the sky, such as number counts in a redshift bin, shear, or CMB temperature fluctuations) and {\sl contributions} to the total observed fluctuations of these tracers (such as the biased matter density term in number counts, redshift-space distortions, magnification, etc.).

\subsubsection{Angular power spectra}\label{sssec:2pt.pspec}
\vol{David Alonso}

\revise

The angular power spectrum $C^{ab}_\ell$ between two tracers $a$ and $b$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \langle a_{\ell m}b^*_{\ell m}\rangle\equiv C^{ab}\delta_{\ell\ell'}\delta_{mm'},
\end{equation}
where $a_{\ell m}$/$b_{\ell m}$ can be either the $E$-mode or $B$-mode component of the corresponding field. In what follows we will only deal with fields for which the $B$-modes are identically $0$, and therefore all equations refer to the $E$-$E$ power spectrum. In general this power spectrum can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  C^{ab}_\ell=4\pi\int_0^\infty \frac{dk}{k}\,\mathcal{P}_\Phi(k)\Delta^a_\ell(k)\Delta^b_\ell(k),
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{P}_\Phi(k)$ is the dimensionless power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations, and $\Delta^a$ and $\Delta^b$ are the transfer functions corresponding to these tracers. Each transfer function will receive contributions from different terms. Currently \ccl supports three types of tracers: number counts, galaxy shape distortions and lensing convergence, with the following contributions:

\paragraph{\bf Number counts.} The transfer function for number counts can be decomposed into three contributions: $\Delta^{\rm NC}=\Delta^{\rm D}+\Delta^{\rm RSD}+\Delta^{\rm M}$, where
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Delta^{\rm D}$ is the standard density term proportional to the matter density:
        \begin{equation}
          \Delta^{\rm D}_\ell(k)=\int dz\,p_z(z)\,b(z)\,T_\delta(k,z)\,j_\ell(k\chi(z)),
        \end{equation}
        where $j_\ell(x)$ is $\ell$-th order spherical Bessel function, $T_\delta$ is the matter transfer function, $b(z)$ is the linear clustering bias for this tracer and $p_z(z)$ is the normalized distribution of sources in redshift (i.e. the selection function). The fluctuations in the number density of sources in different redshift bins are therefore treated by \ccl as different tracers. Note that \ccl currently does not support non-linear or scale-dependent bias, but future releases of it will do so under a number of schemes, including perturbative approaches as implemented in e.g. \cite{FASTPT}.
  \item $\Delta^{\rm RSD}$ is the linear contribution from redshift-space distortions:
        \begin{equation}
          \Delta^{\rm RSD}_\ell(k)=\int dz\,\frac{(1+z) p_z(z)}{H(z)}T_\theta(k,z) j_\ell''(k\chi(z)),
        \end{equation}
        where $T_\theta(k,z)$ is the transfer function of $\theta$, the divergence of the comoving velocity field. Note that the RSD contribution to number counts is currently computed by \ccl assuming a linear-theory relation between the matter overdensity and peculiar velocity fields, mediated by the scale-independent growth rate $f$. While this should not be problematic for wide photometric redshift bins and standard cosmological models, users should exercise care when interpreting results for narrow window functions or exotic cosmologies.
  \item $\Delta^{\rm M}$ is the contribution from lensing magnification:
        \begin{align}\nonumber
          \Delta_\ell^{\rm M}(k)=-\ell(\ell+1)\int & \frac{dz}{H(z)} W^{\rm M}(z) \\\label{eq:deltaM}
          &T_{\phi+\psi}(k,z) j_\ell(k\chi(z)),
        \end{align}
        where $T_{\phi+\psi}$ is the transfer function for the Newtonian-gauge scalar metric perturbations, and $W^{\rm M}$ is the magnification window function:
        \begin{equation}
          W^{\rm M}(z)\equiv\int_z^\infty dz'\,p_z(z')\frac{2-5s(z')}{2}\frac{r(\chi'-\chi)}{r(\chi')r(\chi)}.
        \end{equation}
        \todo{Is it not $r(chi')-r(\chi)$ normally at numerator ? same for other integrals below. (from Jeremy, comparing with Bonvin et al. and other references)} \damonge{See Eq. 6.11 in Bartelmann \& Schneider 99.}
        Here $s(z)$ is the magnification bias, given as the logarithmic derivative of the number of sources with magnitude limit, and $r(\chi)$ is the angular comoving distance (see Eq. \ref{eq:angdist}).
\end{itemize}
Note that \ccl currently does not compute relativistic corrections to number counts \cite{2011PhRvD..84d3516C,2011PhRvD..84f3505B}. Although these will be included in the future, their contribution to the total fluctuation is largely subdominant (see \cite{GReffects} and the two references above), and therefore it is safe to work without them in most cases.

\paragraph{\bf Correlated galaxy shapes.} The transfer function for correlated galaxy shapes (intrinsic and lensed) is currently decomposed into two terms: $\Delta^{\rm SH}=\Delta^{\rm WL}+\Delta^{\rm IA}$, where
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Delta^{\rm L}$ is the standard lensing (``cosmic shear'') contribution:
    \begin{align} \label{eq:transfer_lensing}
      \nonumber
      \Delta_\ell^{\rm L}(k)=-\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{(\ell+2)!}{(\ell-2)!}}\int &\frac{dz}{H(z)} W^{\rm L}(z)T_{\phi+\psi}(k,z)\\
      &j_\ell(k\chi(z)),
    \end{align}
    where $W^{\rm L}$ is the lensing kernel, given by
    \begin{equation}
      W^L(z)\equiv\int_z^\infty dz' p_z(z')\frac{r(\chi'-\chi)}{r(\chi')r(\chi)}.
    \end{equation}
  \item $\Delta^{\rm IA}$ is the transfer function for intrinsic galaxy alignments. \ccl currently supports the so-called ``non-linear alignment model'', in which the intrinsic galaxy inertia tensor is proportional the local tidal tensor \cite{2004PhRvD..70f3526H,2007MNRAS.381.1197H}:
    \begin{align}\nonumber
      \Delta_\ell^{\rm IA}(k)=\sqrt{\frac{(\ell+2)!}{(\ell-2)!}}\int &dz\,p_z(z)\,b_{\rm IA}(z)\,f_{\rm red}(z)\\
      &T_\delta(k,z)\,\frac{j_\ell(k\chi(z))}{(k\chi(z))^2}.
    \end{align}
    Here $b_{\rm IA}$ is the so-called alignment bias, and $f_{\rm red}$ is the fraction of red galaxies in the sample. It is understood that only red galaxies are subject to this type of alignment mechanism, therefore $f_{\rm red}$ should be interpreted as ``the fraction of galaxies that suffer intrinsic alignment''. \todo{Elisa, check if phrasing is correct?}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\bf Lensing convergence.} The transfer function for the lensing convergence of a given source plane at redshift $z_*$ receives only one contribution, given by
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_\ell^\kappa(k)=-\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{2}\int_0^{\chi_*}\frac{dz}{H(z)}\,\frac{r(\chi_*-\chi)}{r(\chi)r(\chi_*)}T_{\phi+\psi}(k,z),
\end{equation}
where $\chi_*\equiv\chi(z_*)$.

\noindent
It is worth noting that the equations above should be modified for non-flat cosmologies by replacing the spherical Bessel functions $j_\ell$ with their hyperspherical counterparts \cite{1994ApJ...432....7K}. These are currently not supported by \ccl, and their impact is mostly relevant on low multipoles. The library also assumes a factorizable matter power spectrum at unequal times $P_\delta(k,z_1,z_2)=T_\delta(k,z_1)T_\delta(k,z_2)\,2\pi^2\mathcal{P}_\Phi(k)$ (see \cite{2017PhRvD..95f3522K}). Furthermore, \ccl currently assumes a relation between transfer functions $T_\delta$, $T_\theta$ and $T_{\phi+\psi}$ that is strictly only valid in vanilla $\Lambda$CDM:
\begin{equation}
  T_\delta=-\frac{1+z}{H(z)f(z)}T_\theta=-\frac{k^2}{3H_0^2\Omega_M}\frac{T_{\phi+\psi}}{1+z}.
\end{equation}
These approximations will be revisited in future versions of the library.



\subsubsection{Correlation functions}
\vol{Elisa Chisari, Sukhdeep Singh?}

\revise

Fields can also be correlated in configuration space, and the corresponding correlators are called correlation functions. Let $a$ and $b$ be two fields with spins $s_a$ and $s_b$. We start by defining $\tilde{a}(\nv_1)$ and $\tilde{b}(\nv_2)$ as the fields $a$ and $b$ rotated on the by angles such that the $x$-axis of the tangential coordinate systems at $\nv_1$ and $\nv_2$ become aligned with the vector connecting both points. We can then define two correlation functions:
\begin{equation}\nonumber
  \xi^{ab}_+(\theta)\equiv\left\langle\tilde{a}(\nv_1)\tilde{b}^*(\nv_2)\right\rangle,\hspace{12pt}
  \xi^{ab}_-(\theta)\equiv\left\langle\tilde{a}(\nv_1)\tilde{b}(\nv_2)\right\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\nv_1\cdot\nv_2\equiv\cos\theta$. 

$\xi_{\pm}$ can be related to the power spectra as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cl_xi}
 \xi^{ab}_\pm\sum_\ell\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}\,(\pm1)^{s_b}\,C^{ab\pm}_\ell\,d^\ell_{s_a,\pm s_b}(\theta),
\end{equation}
where $d^\ell_{mm'}$ are the Wigner-$d$ matrices\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_D-matrix}}
\citep{Ng1999,2004MNRAS.350..914C} and we have defined the power spectra
\begin{equation}
  C^{ab\pm}_\ell\equiv\left(C^{a_Eb_E}_\ell\pm C^{a_Bb_B}_\ell\right)+i\left(C^{a_Bb_E}_\ell\pm C^{a_Eb_B}_\ell\right),
\end{equation}
which reduces to the $E$-$E$ power spectrum when all $B$-modes are 0.

Note that, scalar quantities are real, any correlation involving at least one spin-$0$ field only has one non-unique correlation function. In these cases, the Wigner-$d$ matrices can also be expressed in terms of associated Legendre polynomials $P^m_\ell$, and therefore Eq. \ref{eq:cl_xi} becomes
\begin{align}
  \xi^{ab}(\theta)&=\sum_\ell\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}\,C^{ab}_\ell\sqrt{\frac{(\ell-s_a)!}{(\ell+s_a)!}}P^{s_a}_\ell(\cos\theta)\\
                  &=\sum_\ell\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}\,C^{ab}_\ell P_\ell(\cos\theta),
\end{align}
where the last equality holds for $s_a=0$, and both expressions assume $s_b=0$.

In the flat-sky approximation we can take the small-scale limit $\ell\gg s_1,s_2$ and approximate 
\begin{equation}
  d_{s_1s_2}^\ell(\theta)\longrightarrow J_{s_1-s_2}(\ell\theta),
\end{equation}
where $J_\alpha(x)$ is the Bessel function of order $\alpha$. Eq. \ref{eq:cl_xi} then becomes\footnote{See the weak lensing review by \citet{Bartelmann01}, page 44 and \citet{Joachimi10}.}
\begin{equation}
  \xi^{ab}_{\pm}(\theta)=\left(\pm1\right)^{s_b}\int\frac{d\ell\,\ell}{2\pi}\,C^{ab\pm}_\ell J_{s_a\mp s_b}(\ell\theta).
\end{equation}

In summary, for spins 0 and 2, the three relevant cases for the cosmological observables supported by \ccl are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $s_a=s_b=0$ (e.g. galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-$\kappa$ and $\kappa$-$\kappa$):
    \begin{align}\label{eq:xi00full}
      \xi^{ab}(\theta)&=\sum_\ell\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}\,C^{ab}_\ell P_\ell(\cos\theta)\hspace{5pt}\text{(full-sky)}\\\label{eq:xi00flat}
                      &=\int_0^\infty\frac{d\ell\,\ell}{2\pi}\,C^{ab}_\ell J_0(\ell\theta)\hspace{25pt}\text{(flat-sky)}
    \end{align}
  \item $s_a=2$, $s_b=0$ (e.g. galaxy-shear, $\kappa$-shear):
    \begin{align}\label{eq:xi02full}
      \xi^{ab}(\theta)&=\sum_\ell\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}\,C^{ab}_\ell d^\ell_{2,0}(\theta)\hspace{15pt}\text{(full-sky)}\\\label{eq:xi02flat}
                      &=\int_0^\infty\frac{d\ell\,\ell}{2\pi}\,C^{ab}_\ell J_2(\ell\theta)\hspace{25pt}\text{(flat-sky)}
    \end{align}
  \item $s_a=s_b=2$ (e.g. shear-shear):
    \begin{align}\label{eq:xi22full}
      \xi^{ab}_\pm(\theta)&=\sum_\ell\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}\,C^{ab}_\ell d^\ell_{2,\pm2}(\theta)\hspace{12pt}\text{(full-sky)}\\\label{eq:xi22flat}
                      &=\int_0^\infty\frac{d\ell\,\ell}{2\pi}\,C^{ab}_\ell J_{2\mp2}(\ell\theta)\hspace{16pt}\text{(flat-sky)}
    \end{align}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{3-dimensional spatial correlation function.}
In addition to the angular correlation functions, \ccl can also be used to compute the 3-dimensional spatial correlation function $\xi(r)$, given as a Fourier transform of the matter power spectrum:
\begin{equation}
\xi(r) = \frac{1}{2 \pi^2} \int dk \; k^2 P(k) \frac{\sin(kr)}{kr}
\end{equation}
In the future \ccl will be expanded to incorporate the calculation of the higher-order multipoles needed to characterize the redshift-space 3D correlation function in the presence of RSDs.

\subsection{Halo mass function}
\vol{Antonio Villarreal - Could Use Review}

\vol{Tom - made edits. Text written by Antonio that I changed is left as comments. Remove when ready. Removed discussion of bias from this section.}

Being able to calculate the halo abundance as a function of mass is a necessary step to being able to constrain cosmology with probes such as galaxy clustering. While analytic functions are the traditional means of predicting evolution, calibration is frequently required against cosmological simulations. In order to reach the high precision for cosmological constraints in a self-consistent fashion, it is ultimately necessary to use cosmological simulations; we implement this with halo mass functions with parameters fit to these simulations. The calculation of the halo mass function focuses around the spherical overdensity method of halo finding, in which the size of a halo can be defined with:

\begin{equation}
\bar{\rho}(r_{\Delta}) = \Delta \times \bar{\rho}_{\mathrm{m}},
\end{equation}

where a spherical halo with radius $r_{\Delta}$ has an average density $\bar{\rho}$ equal to the overdensity parameter $\Delta$ times the mean background density of the universe, $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}$. Within the literature, the choice of $\Delta$ can vary considerably, as observations focusing on the compact cores of haloes often take much larger values of $\Delta$, while the fiducial definition in most halo clustering studies is a definition of $\Delta = 200$. We note that another common definition exists which utilizes the critical density of the universe, $\rho_{\mathrm{crit}}$; this introduces a simple conversion factor between the two definitions that must be accounted for. Currently, \ccl only accepts overdensity parameters with respect to the mean matter density, but we plan to allow for self-consistent handling of critical density based definitions in the future.

The halo mass function is defined as
\begin{equation}
\frac{dn}{dM}=f(\sigma)\frac{\bar{\rho}_\mathrm{m}}{M}\frac{d\ln{\sigma^{-1}}}{dM},
\label{eq:halo_mass_function}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number density of halos of a given mass $M$ associated with the RMS variance of the matter density field $\sigma^2$.
In CCL calling this function returns the mass function in logarithmic mass bins, $dn/d\log_{10}{M}$, where the input is the halo mass $M$ and scale factor $a$.

The halo mass $M$ is related to $\sigma$ by first computing the radius $R$ that would enclose a mass $M$ in a homogeneous Universe at $z=0$:
\begin{equation}
  M=\frac{H_0^2}{2G}R^3\,\rightarrow \frac{M}{M_\odot}=1.162\times10^{12}\Omega_Mh^2\,\left(\frac{R}{1\,{\rm Mpc}}\right)^3.
\end{equation}
The RMS density contrast in spheres of radius $R$ can then be computed as
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_R^2 = \frac{1}{2\pi^2}\int dk\,k^2\,P(k)\,\tilde{W}_R^2(k)
  \label{eq:sigR}
\end{equation}
where $P(k)$ is the linear matter power spectrum and $\tilde{W}(kR)$ is the Fourier transform of a spherical top hat window function,
\begin{equation}
\tilde{W}_R(k) = \frac{3}{(kR)^3}[\sin(kR)-kR\cos(kR)].
\end{equation}

One commonly used halo mass function definition within the literature is the \citet{Tinker2010} fitting function. This fitting function has been developed using collisionless $N$-body simulation data, using haloes determined by spherical overdensities. This is an extension of the \citet{Tinker2008} halo mass function, which is also included within \ccl as a comparative option. This fitting function assumes little change with respect to cosmological parameters. Further, it includes a redshift scaling with is assumed to sharply end at a redshift of $z = 3$. This halo mass function is calibrated within the range of $10^{10.5} h\mathrm{M}_\odot \leq M \leq 10^{15.5} h\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at a redshift of $z = 0$.

For purposes of comparison, we also have included the results of \citet{Angulo2012}, which uses the Millenium XXL simulation in order to study galaxy cluster scaling relations. As part of this study, they have calculated their own fit to the \citet{Tinker2010} fitting function. While this additional halo mass function is available, it has not been extended to a broad range of overdensity parameter $\Delta$, nor has it been extended beyond a redshift of $z = 0$.

The \citet{Tinker2008} fitting function uses the following parameterisation for the multiplicity function:
\begin{equation}
f(\sigma)=A\Big[\Big(\frac{\sigma}{b}\Big)^{-a}+1\Big]e^{-c/{\sigma}^2},
\end{equation}
where $A$, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are fitting parameters that have additional redshift scaling and $\sigma$ is the RMS variance of the density field smoothed on some scale $M$ at some scale factor $a$. This basic form is modified for the \citet{Angulo2012} formulation. The resulting form is
\begin{equation}
f(\sigma)=A\Big[\Big(\frac{b}{\sigma}+1\Big)^{-a}\Big]e^{-c/{\sigma}^2},
\end{equation}
where the only change is in the formulation of the second term. Note that the fitting parameters in the \citet{Angulo2012} formulation do not contain any redshift dependence and the use of it is primarily for testing and benchmark purposes.

The \citet{Tinker2010} model parameterizes the halo mass function in terms of the peak height, $\nu = \delta_c/\sigma(M)$, where $\delta_c=1.686$ is the critical density for collapse. The multiplicity function is then written as
\begin{equation}
  f(\nu) = \alpha[1+(\beta\nu)^{-2\phi}]\nu^{2\eta}e(-\gamma\nu^2/2).
\end{equation}

We note that these halo mass functions, while implemented to high {\em numerical} accuracy, carry their own uncertainties. It has not been significantly studied whether the halo mass function (or halo bias function) is universal with respect to changes in dark energy parameterisation.
%Further, \citet{Tinker2010} found a $\sim6\%$ scatter when determining the halo bias due to differences in simulations.
%This is in addition to a $5\%$ error in the mass function alone.
\citet{Tinker2008,Tinker2010} quote 5\% accuracy of their mass funcitons.
This result is consistent with the work of \citet{Watson2013}, which also finds a $5\%$ level difference in comparison to the Tinker fitting function. Further study will be required in the future in order to gain percent level accuracy in determining the halo mass function.

\subsection{Halo bias}
\vol{Antonio Villarreal}

\cont{Halo bias definition.}

An important step in many interpretations of the halo model is to have a measure of the bias of dark matter halos, defined as the ratio of the halo power spectrum to the linear dark matter power spectrum,
\begin{equation}
  b^2(k) = \frac{P_h(k)}{P_{\mathrm{lin}}(k)}.
  \label{eq:halo_bias}
\end{equation}

As with measures of the halo mass function, high accuracy cosmological constraints requires the use of numerical simulations to develop fitting functions and emulators. We note that we will define haloes as in the above subsection focusing on the halo mass function. {\tt CCL} currently implements the halo bias fitting function results in \citet{Tinker2010}, though future improvements will likely require the use of emulator methods.

The \citet{Tinker2010} model parameterizes the halo bias in terms of the peak height, $\nu = \delta_c / \sigma(M)$, where $\delta_c$ is the critical density for collapse and is chosen to be $1.686$ for this particular parameterization. We can then parameterize the halo mass function and halo bias as
\begin{eqnarray}
  b(\nu) &=& 1 - A\frac{\nu^a}{\nu^a + {\delta_c}^a} + B\nu^b+C\nu^c,\\
  f(\nu) &=& \alpha[1+(\beta\nu)^{-2\phi}]\nu^{2\eta}e(-\gamma\nu^2/2).
\end{eqnarray}

Again, while high {\em numerical} accuracy has been verified, there is a remaining uncertainty. \citet{Tinker2010} found a $\sim6\%$ scatter when determining the halo bias due to differences in simulations alone. In addition, this parameterization does not include a careful exploration of any impact due to changes in the dark energy equation of state. As with the halo mass function, studies will be required to reach accuracy at the percent level for any cosmological predictions. 

\subsection{Halo model}
\label{sec:halo_model}
\vol{Alexander Mead}

In this section we review a basic halo-model computation \citep{Seljak2000,Peacock2000,Cooray2002} of the cross-correlation between any two cosmological fields and only requires knowledge of the halo profiles of the field in question. For example, in the case of the matter-density auto spectrum we need only know the halo density profiles. For the galaxy spectrum we require knowledge of the number of, and distribution of, galaxies as a function of halo mass. In this simple form the halo model is approximate and makes the assumption that haloes are \emph{linearly} biased with respect to the \emph{linear} matter field and also assumes that haloes are spherical with properties that are determined solely by the halo mass. It is possible to go beyond these simplified assumptions, and we direct the interested reader to \cite{Cooray2002,Smith2007,Giocoli2010,Smith2011}.

The eventual aim for CCL is to have a halo model that can calculate the auto- and cross-spectra for any cosmological field combinations with parameters that can be taken either from numerical simulations or observational data. Currently we have only implemented the case of the matter-density auto spectrum, but we keep the notation as general as possible in the following:

Consider two 3D cosmological fields $\rho_i$ and $\rho_j$, the cross power spectrum at a given redshift can be written as a sum of a two- and a one-halo term given by
\begin{equation}
P_{2\mathrm{H},ij}(k)=P_{\mathrm{lin}}(k)
\prod_{n=i,j}\left[\int_0^\infty b(M)\frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}M}W_n(M,k)\;\mathrm{d}M\right]\ ,
\label{eq:two_halo}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P_{1\mathrm{H},ij}(k)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}M}W_i(M,k)W_j(M,k)\;\mathrm{d}M\ ,
\label{eq:one_halo}
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the halo mass, $\mathrm{d}n/\mathrm{d}M$ is the halo mass function defined in equation~(\ref{eq:halo_mass_function}) and $b(M)$ is the linear halo bias with respect to the linear matter density field, defined as the large-scale limit of equation~(\ref{eq:halo_bias}).

Equations~(\ref{eq:two_halo}) and (\ref{eq:one_halo}) contain the (spherical) Fourier transform of the halo profile, or halo `window function':
\begin{equation}
W_i(M,k)=\int_0^\infty4\pi r^2\frac{\sin(kr)}{kr}\rho_{\mathrm{H},i}(M,r)\;\mathrm{d}r\ ,
\label{eq:window_function}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{\mathrm{H},i}(M,r)$ is the radial profile for the field $i$ in a host halo of mass $M$. For example, if one is interested in matter fields then this would be the halo density profile, if one were interested in galaxies then this would be the number density and distribution of galaxies around a halo of mass $M$.

%The dimensionless mass function, $f(\nu)$, is related to $n(M)$ via
%\begin{equation}
%f(\nu)\,\mathrm{d}\nu=\frac{M}{\bar\rho}n(M)\;\mathrm{d}M\ .
%\label{eq:mass_function}
%\end{equation}
%and is written in terms of the mass variable $\nu=\delta_\mathrm{c}/\sigma(M)$: $\delta_\mathrm{c}$ is the critical linear density for halo collapse: $\delta_\mathrm{c}\simeq 1.686$, but with a weak cosmology dependence.  $\sigma(M)$ is the variance in the linear matter field when filtered on a Lagrangian scale $R$ corresponding to mass $M=4\pi R^3/3$:
%\begin{equation}
%\sigma^2(R)=\int_0^{\infty}\Delta_{\mathrm{lin}}^2(k)\, T^2(kR)\;\mathrm{d}\ln{k}\ ,
%\label{eq:variance}
%\end{equation}
%with $T$ being the Fourier Transform of a real-space top-hat filter
%\begin{equation}
%T(x)=\frac{3}{x^3}(\sin{x}-x\cos{x})\ .
%\label{eq:top_hat}
%\end{equation}
Note that the halo mass function and bias \emph{must} satisfy the following properties for the total power spectrum to have the correct large-scale limit\footnote{Note that achieving these correct limits for some fields is difficult numerically because of the large amount of mass contained in low mass haloes according to most popular mass functions. Special care must be taken with the two-halo integral in the case of matter power spectra.}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\bar\rho_\mathrm{m}}\int_0^\infty M\frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}M}\;\mathrm{d}M=1\ ,
\label{eq:mf_normalisation}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\bar\rho_\mathrm{m}}\int_0^\infty Mb(M)\frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}M}\;\mathrm{d}M=1\ .
\label{eq:bias_normalisation}
\end{equation}
If one uses a mass function and bias pair that are related via the peak-background split formalism \citep{Mo1996,Sheth2001} the these conditions are automatically satisfied. In words these equations enforce that all matter is associated to a halo and that matter is on average unbiased with respect to itself. In the convention used in CCL the units of $P(k)$ will be exactly the units of $\rho_i\rho_j / \mathrm{Mpc}^3$. The units of the $W_i$ are those of $\rho_i$ multiplied by volume.

For the matter power spectrum we use the halo profiles of \citeauthor*{Navarro1997} (NFW; \citeyear{Navarro1997}):
\begin{equation}
\rho_\mathrm{H}(M,r)\propto\frac{1}{r/r_\mathrm{s}(1+r/r_\mathrm{s})^2}\ ,
\label{eq:NFW_profile}
\end{equation}
which is written in terms of a scale radius $r_\mathrm{s}$. The constant of proportionality fixed by the condition that the halo has total mass $M$ when the boundary is set at the virial radius $r_\mathrm{v}$, which is set such that the halo has a fixed density $\Delta_\mathrm{v}$ with respect to the mean
\begin{equation}
M=4\pi r_\mathrm{v}^3\Delta_\mathrm{v}\bar\rho\ .
\label{eq:virial_radius}
\end{equation}
Finally, the scale radius is usually expressed in terms of the mass-dependent halo concentration parameter $c(M)=r_\mathrm{v}/r_\mathrm{s}$. We use the simple mass-concentration relation from \cite{Bullock2001}
\begin{equation}
c(M)=9\left(\frac{M}{M_*}\right)^{-0.13}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\delta_\mathrm{c}/\sigma(M_*)=1$.
Note that, in order to be consistent, one should use a value of $\Delta_\mathrm{v}$ and $c(M)$ that is consistent with the halo definition used for the halo mass function and bias.

\section{Implementation of high-accuracy cosmological functions}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Background functions \& growth of perturbations}
\vol{Mustapha Ishak}
\label{sec:distances}
\cont{Initial conditions. Normalization. Units and sensitivity to physical constants (G, c etc).}

Including/excluding radiation in the computation of the comoving distances and the growth function can easily make a difference of $10^{-4}$ at the redshifts required in this comparison.

We have performed a comparison of the physical constants used in \ccl to those used in {\tt GSL} and {\tt CLASS} as well as published sources such as the NIST Handbook and PDG Review of Particle Physics \todo{The comparison was with PDG2013, we could update that.}. Where possible, we have set constants to the values that are used internally in {\tt CLASS}. This includes the value of the gravitational constant, the Boltzmann constant, the Planck constant, the speed of light, and the electron charge. {\tt CLASS} does not include a definition of the solar mass or the Stefan-Boltzmann constant so we use the values used by {\tt GSL}. After comparison between the physical constants used in \ccl and those of the sources mentioned above, we have found better than $10^{-4}$ agreement with everything except the gravitational constant.

The value of the gravitational constant, $G$, enters into the critical density. We found that failure to define $G$ with sufficient precision would result in lack of convergence at the $10^{-4}$ level between the different submissions. Importantly, note that CAMB barely has $10^{-4}$ precision in $G$ (and similarly, there might be other constants within CAMB/CLASS for which one should check the precision level). For \ccl, we are using the value from {\tt CLASS}.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Matter power spectrum}
\vol{Elisa Chisari}

\cont{Interpolation strategy. Sensitivity to spline parameters and sampling in $k$. Settings that control speed vs. accuracy. }

For the matter power spectrum, the spline is performed in two variables: the logarithmically-spaced wavenumber and the logarithmically and linearly-spaced scale factor. Splining the {\tt CLASS} output leads to some precision loss (compared to direct outputs from {\tt CLASS}). We quantify this, along with the impact of extrapolation, in the following subsection.

The computation of the power spectrum from {\tt CLASS} can be significantly sped up by extrapolating in the range $k>$~{\tt K$\_$MAX$\_$SPLINE} and $k<$~{\tt K$\_$MIN}. In this section, we describe the implementation of the extrapolation and the accuracy attained. These tests are performed in a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\Omega_c=0.25$, $\Omega_b=0.05$, $A_s=2.1\times10^{-9}$, $h=0.7$ and $n_s=0.96$.

We first describe the extrapolation at high wavenumbers. The introduction of the parameter {\tt K$\_$MAX$\_$SPLINE} allows us to spline the matter power spectrum within the {\tt cosmo} structure up to that value of $k$ (in units of $1/$Mpc). A separate {\tt K$\_$MAX} parameter sets the limit for evaluation of the matter power spectrum. The range between {\tt K$\_$MAX$\_$SPLINE}~$<k<$~{\tt K$\_$MAX} is evaluated by performing a second order Taylor expansion in $\ln k$ within the static routine {\tt ccl$\_$power$\_$extrapol$\_$highk}.

First, we compute the first and second derivative of $\ln P(k,z)$ at $k_0={\rm \tt K\_MAX}-2\Delta\ln k$ by computing the numerical derivatives by finite differences using GSL. The fiducial choice for $\Delta\ln k$ is $10^{-2}$. We then apply a second order Taylor expansion to extrapolate the matter power spectrum to $k>$~{\tt K$\_$MAX$\_$SPLINE}. The Taylor expansion gives
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \ln P(k,z) &\simeq& \ln P(k_0,z) + \frac{d\ln P}{d\ln k}(\ln k_0,z) (\ln k-\ln k_0)  \nonumber\\
  &+& \frac{1}{2}  \frac{d^2\ln P}{d\ln k^2}(\ln k_0,z) (\ln k-\ln k_0)^2.
  \label{eq:NLPSTaylor}
\end{eqnarray}

The accuracy of this approximation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:NLextrapol} for redshifts $z=0$, $z=3$ and $z=20$. We compare the nonlinear matter power spectrum at these redshifts, computed with the previously described approximation, to the matter power spectrum obtained by setting the power spectrum splines to high values. We find that for typical values of $\Delta \ln k=10^{-2}$ and {\tt K$\_$MAX$\_$SPLINE}$=50$/Mpc, $\ln P$ has converged to an accuracy that surpasses the expected impact of baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum at $k>10/$Mpc.  (For an estimate of the impact of baryons on the total matter power spectrum, see \citealt{Schneider15}.) The lower {\tt K$\_$MAX$\_$SPLINE} is, the faster \ccl will run. The optimum choice of {\tt K$\_$MAX$\_$SPLINE} is left to the user for their particular application.

We also extrapolate the power spectrum at small wavenumbers within the static routine {\tt ccl\_power\_extrapol\_lowk}. In this case, the power spectrum below {\tt K$\_$MIN} is obtained by a power-law extrapolation with index $n_s$:
\begin{equation}
  \log P(k<{\tt K\_MIN},z) = \log P({\tt K\_MIN},z) + n_s (\log k-\log{\tt K\_MIN})
\end{equation}
The value adopted for {\tt K\_MIN} depends on the choice of power spectrum method. For CLASS and the nonlinear power spectrum, we adopt {\tt K\_MIN} that coincides with the smallest wavenumber output by CLASS, {\tt K\_MIN}$=7\times 10^{-6}$/Mpc.\footnote{For BBKS, the power spectrum is computed analytically at all $k$, there is no extrapolation. For the Eisenstein \& Hu implementation, the splines of the power spectrum span {\tt K\_MIN\_DEFAULT}$<k<${\tt K$\_$MAX$\_$SPLINE}, so there is only extrapolation at high $k$.} Note that this parameter is different from {\tt K\_MIN\_DEFAULT}, which sets the minimum $k$ for integrations and which is set by default to {\tt K\_MIN\_DEFAULT}$=5\times 10^{-5}$/Mpc. Hence, in practice, no extrapolation is occurring in this case, unless the user specifically asks for an output power spectra below {\tt K\_MIN\_DEFAULT} for their own purposes.

%------------------------

With the implementation described above, the power spectrum splines are initialized up to {\tt K$\_$MAX$\_$SPLINE}. This is also true for the linear matter power spectrum, which is used within \ccl in particular to obtain $\sigma_8$ (see Eq. \ref{eq:sigR}). We have tested how the procedure described in the previous section affects the convergence of the linear matter power spectrum. We compare the fiducial \ccl output to the case where we set {\tt K$\_$MAX$\_$SPLINE}~$=5\times 10^3/$Mpc. The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:NLextrapol}. For some applications that use the linear power spectrum, the user might need to increase the value of {\tt K$\_$MAX$\_$SPLINE}.

As in the previous section, the power spectrum at small wavenumber is extrapolated using a power-law. This extrapolation is performed below a fiducial value of {\tt K\_MIN\_DEFAULT}$=5\times 10^{-5}$.

We have found that changing {\tt A$\_$SPLINE$\_$NA$\_$PK} to $200$, or changing {\tt N$\_$K} to $5000$, does not change the results presented in Figures \ref{fig:NLextrapol} in this section.

\subsection{Angular power spectra}
\vol{David Alonso}

Different numerical approaches have been implemented in the library in order to expedite the computation of angular power spectra. We describe these here.

\subsubsection{Limber approximation}
\vol{David Alonso, J\'er\'emy Neveu}

\revise

As shown in Section \ref{sssec:2pt.pspec}, computing each transfer function contributing to a given power spectrum involves a radial projection (i.e. an integral over redshift or $z$ or $\chi$), and thus computing full power spectra consists of a triple integral for each $\ell$. This can be computationally intensive, but can be significantly simplified in certain regimes by using the Limber approximation, given by:
\begin{equation}
 j_\ell(x)\simeq\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2\ell+1}}\,\delta\left(\ell+\frac{1}{2}-x\right).
\end{equation}
This eliminates the integrals associated with each of the two transfer functions, massively accelerating the calculation.

Thus for each $k$ and $\ell$ we can define a radial distance $\chi_\ell\equiv(\ell+1/2)/k$, with corresponding redshift $z_\ell$. Substituting this in the expressions presented in Section \ref{sssec:2pt.pspec}, the power spectrum can be computed as a single integral:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:limber}
 C^{ab}_\ell=\frac{2}{2\ell+1}\int_0^\infty dk\,P_\delta\left(k,z_\ell\right)
 \tilde{\Delta}^a_\ell(k)\tilde{\Delta}^b_\ell(k).
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
 &\tilde{\Delta}_\ell^{\rm D}(k)=p_z(z_\ell)\,b(z_\ell)\,H(z_\ell)\\
 &\tilde{\Delta}_\ell^{\rm RSD}(k)=
 \frac{1+8\ell}{(2\ell+1)^2}\,p_z(z_\ell)\,f(z_\ell)\,H(z_\ell)-\\\nonumber
 &\hspace{48pt}\frac{4}{2\ell+3}\sqrt{\frac{2\ell+1}{2\ell+3}}p_z(z_{\ell+1})\,f(z_{\ell+1})\,H(z_{\ell+1})\\
 &\tilde{\Delta}_\ell^{\rm M}(k)=3\Omega_{M,0}H_0^2\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{k^2}\,
 \frac{(1+z_\ell)}{\chi_\ell}W^{\rm M}(z_\ell)\\
 &\tilde{\Delta}_\ell^{\rm L}(k)=\frac{3}{2}\Omega_{M,0}H_0^2\sqrt{\frac{(\ell+2)!}{(\ell-2)}}\frac{1}{k^2}\,
 \frac{1+z_\ell}{\chi_\ell}W^{\rm L}(z_\ell)\\
 &\tilde{\Delta}_\ell^{\rm IA}(k)=\sqrt{\frac{(\ell+2)!}{(\ell-2)!}}\frac{p_z(z_\ell)\,b_{\rm IA}(z_\ell)f_{\rm red}(z_\ell)H(z_\ell)}{(\ell+1/2)^2}.
\end{align}

The Limber approximation works best for wide radial kernels and high $\ell$.

\subsubsection{Beyond Limber: \texttt{Angpow}}
\vol{J\'er\'emy Neveu}

\ccl incorporates natively routines to compute the $C^{ab}_\ell$ angular power spectra as described above without the Limber approximation. The algorithm performs first the integrals over $z$ for both tracers, and ends with the $k$ integral. This computation is much slower than using the Limber approximation, but it ends up with precise angular power spectra at low $\ell$, and correct cross-correlations between tracers (the Limber approximation fails at reproducing the beat phenomenon $j_\ell(x)\times j_\ell(x')$). The integration of these routines has been tested against the \texttt{CLASS} code and recover the same angular power spectra when precision parameters are set to high values.

However, the computation of the $C^{ab}_\ell$ without the Limber approximation is too costly in terms of computing time using this method, if one wants to explore extensively a full cosmological parameter space. The aim of the \texttt{Angpow} software \citep{2017arXiv170103592C} is to compute the angular power spectra  $C_{\ell}^{ab}$  without any Limber numerical approximation in a faster way but still accurately. \ccl has been linked to the \texttt{Angpow} code,  which is briefly described here.

The angular power spectrum for two tracers $C_{\ell}^{ab}$ is computed in \texttt{Angpow} according to the following expression
\begin{equation}
  C_{\ell}^{ab} = \iint_0^\infty \mathrm{d} z \mathrm{d} z^\prime  p_{z_1}(z_1) p_{z_2}(z^\prime) \times \int_0^\infty \mathrm{d} k\ f_{\ell}(z, k) f_{\ell}(z^\prime, k).
  \label{eq-clz1z2-obs}
\end{equation}
The auxiliary function $f_\ell(z,k)$ can be defined without loss of generality as
\begin{equation}
f_\ell(z,k) \equiv  \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\  k \sqrt{P_\delta(k,z)}\ \widetilde{\Delta}_\ell(z,k)\label{eq-fell-func}
\end{equation}
with $\widetilde{\Delta}_\ell(z,k)$ the function describing the physical processes such as matter density fluctuations, redshift-space distortions as described for instance in references \citet{2008cmb..book.....D,2009PhRvD..80h3514Y,2010PhRvD..82h3508Y, 2011PhRvD..84d3516C,2011PhRvD..84f3505B}. Currently, the \texttt{Angpow} version delivered with \ccl only can deal with galaxy clustering tracers (no lensing) and this without the magnification lensing term (equation \ref{eq:deltaM}). The incorporation of those transfer functions is left for a future work, but in principle \texttt{Angpow} has already the capability to treat them. For now, for galaxy clustering tracers we define $\widetilde{\Delta}_\ell(z,k)$ as 
\begin{equation}
 \widetilde{\Delta}_\ell(z,k) \approx b(z) j_\ell(k \chi(z)) - f(z) j_\ell^{\prime\prime}(k \chi(z)) 
\end{equation}
with $j_\ell(x)$ and $j_\ell^{\prime\prime}(x)$ the spherical Bessel function of order $\ell$ and its second derivative, and $f(z)$ the growth rate of structures.
%\end{itemize}

In \texttt{Angpow}, the inner integral in $k$ is computed first. 
To conduct the computation of such integral of highly oscillating functions, the 3C-algorithm described in details in reference \citep{2017arXiv170103592C} is used. In brief, it lies on the projection of the oscillating $f_\ell(z_,k)$ onto Chebyshev series of order $2^N$, the product of the two Chebyshev series is performed with a $2^{2N}$ Chebyshev serie; then, the integral is computed thanks to a Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature. At the end the integrals over $z$ are performed via again an optimised Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature. All the Chebyshev expansions and the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature are performed via the \textit{Discrete Cosine Transform} of type I from the DCT-I fast transform of FFTW library.

The \texttt{Angpow} software  was tested against \texttt{CLASS} and the native \ccl computation and can perform the same computations approximately an order of magnitude faster ($\mathcal{O}(1s)$). %Note that \texttt{Angpow} is written in C++ with OpenMP, to distribute the computation of a single $C_\ell$ on a single thread.
Its precision and speed parameters are optimised so that the relative numerical error compared with an high precision computation is two orders of magnitude below the relative cosmic variance $\sqrt{2/(2\ell+1)}$, from $\ell=2$ to $\ell=1000$. 

As in the general case the Limber approximation is valid at high $\ell$ values, the \ccl user can define an $\ell$ threshold to switch from the non-Limber slow computation to the faster Limber approximation.

\subsection{Correlation functions}
\vol{Elisa Chisari, Sukhdeep Singh?}

\revise

The exact Equations (\ref{eq:xi00full}, \ref{eq:xi02full}, \ref{eq:xi22full}) relating the angular correlation functions and power spectra involve carrying out $N_\theta\times\ell_{\rm max}$ operations, where $\ell_{\rm max}\sim O(10^{4-5})$ is the maximum multipole needed to achieve convergence and $N_\theta$ is the number of angular scales $\theta$ at which the angular correlation function needs to be computed. Thus, evaluating these expressions directly becomes prohibitively slow and should be avoided except in regimes where other approximations are not valid. In particular \ccl only supports the brute-force evaluation of these equations for correlations involving at least one spin-0 field. The currently preferred method in \ccl is to use the flat-sky approximation and evaluate the Hankel transforms (Eqs. \ref{eq:xi00flat}, \ref{eq:xi02flat}, \ref{eq:xi22flat}).

\ccl currently provides two methods to compute Hankel transforms:
\begin{itemize}
 \item {\bf Brute-force integration.} \ccl allows users to compute Hankel transforms by brute-force integration over the Bessel functions. The oscillating nature of these functions makes this method slow and not appropriate for likelihood-sampling. The preferred method to compute correlation functions is through the use of {\tt FFTlog} (see below), and we support the brute-force method only for testing and validation.
 \item {\bf FFTlog.} The public code {\tt FFTlog}\footnote{\url{http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog/}} is able to compute fast Hankel transforms through the assumption that the kernels of these transforms are periodic functions in logarithmic space. The Hankel transform can then be solved using Fast Fourier Transforms at a much lower computational expense than brute-force integration \citep{Hamilton2000,Talman2009}. \ccl incorporates a version of the {\tt FFTlog} method with only minor modifications from the original. The only potential drawbacks of this methods is the need to sample the kernels (i.e. the $C_\ell$) on very small scales to ensure the convergence of the method. To do this, \ccl extrapolates the power spectrum as a power law ($C_\ell\propto\ell^\beta$). We have verified that this method agrees with the brute-force integration  well within cosmic-variance uncertainties.
\end{itemize}

We should also note that other approaches relating the correlation functions directly with the 3D matter power spectrum (E.g. \cite{2017ApJ...845...28C}) could be useful in accelerating this computation, and we will explore these avenues in the future.

\subsection{Halo mass function}
\vol{Antonio Villarreal - Could Use Review}

\cont{Evaluation of derivatives. Interpolations for different values of $\Delta$. Precision of $\sigma(M)$ calculation.}

To achieve $10^{-4}$ precision in $\sigma(M)$ and the normalisation of the power spectrum, one should check that the integral of $\sigma_8$ and $\sigma(M)$ has converged for the chosen values of $\{k_{\rm min},k_{\rm max}\}$. After checking convergence, we achieved the desired precision.

Also note that for $\sigma(M)$, it is important to set the desired precision level correctly for the numerical integrator. The integral usually yields $\sigma^2(M)$, and not $\sigma(M)$. Hence, one has to set the desired precision taking the exponent into account.

Derivatives are calculated utilizing a spline that is built off of the previously described $\sigma(M)$ spline. As such, these splines cover the range from $10^6$ to $10^{17} M_\odot$. For each value of $\log(M)$ in our spline evaluation, we calculate the value of $\sigma(M)$ half a step in either direction. We use the difference compared to the mass spacing to calculate an approximate derivative, which is then used in the spline interpolation. This has been tested to meet our necessary precision for the halo mass function within the mass range explored by \citet{Tinker2010}. We note that there the accuracy is reduced at the edges of these splines and exploring extreme mass ranges may require changes in the parameters to initialize these splines.

In order to accomodate a wide range of values of the overdensity parameter $\Delta$, we have generated a spline interpolation between best fit values as defined by \citet{Tinker2008} and \citet{Tinker2010}. This covers a dynamic range from $\Delta=200$ to $3200$. Within this range, we interpolate in the space of the fit parameter and $\log\Delta$ using the Akima interpolation built from piecewise third order polynomials. We have chosen this rather than the fitting formulas utilized in \citet{Tinker2010} in order to assure high precision match to the Tinker halo mass function when choosing a value of $Delta$ directly from the paper.

\vol{Danielle Leonard}

\cont{Approximations. Approach to performing integrals.}

\subsection{Implementation of photometric redshifts}
\vol{Danielle Leonard}

\cont{Explain approach to photometric redshifts and flexibility to pass user-defined function.}

Redshifts of LSST galaxies will be obtained via photometry. Therefore, performing any cosmological analysis which incorporates redshift information therefore requires a model for the probability of measuring a photometric redshift $z_{\rm ph}$ for an object with hypothetical spectroscopic redshift $z_{\rm s}$.  In order to maintain agnosticism towards the optimal model, and hence to allow for the future inclusion of advancements from ongoing research, \ccl allows the user to flexibly input a photometric redshift model. In addition, for ease of use, \ccl provides the option of using a built-in function for a simple Gaussian photometric redshift probability distribution.

In order to use \ccl with a custom-input photometric redshift model, the user writes a function which accepts as input a photometric redshift, a spectroscopic redshift, and a pointer to a structure containing any further parameters of the model. This function will return the probability of measuring the input photometric redshift given the input spectroscopic redshift. The photometric redshift model can then be used, for example, when computing $\frac{dN}{dz}^i$ in photometric redshift bin $i$, as given by:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{dz}^i = \frac{\frac{dN}{dz}\int_{z_i}^{z_{i+1}} dz' p(z,z')}{\int_{z_{\rm min}}^{z_{\rm max}}dz \frac{dN}{dz} \int_{z_i}^{z_{i+1}}dz' p(z, z')}
\label{photoz}
\end{equation}
where $p(z,z')$ is the photometric redshift probability distribution, and $z_{i}$ and $z_{i+1}$ are the photo-$z$ edges of the bin in question. In the case of the simple Gaussian photometric redshift model for which support is included in \ccl out of the box, $p(z, z')$ is given as
\begin{equation}
p(z,z') = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}\sigma_z} \exp\left(-\frac{(z-z')^2}{2\sigma_z^2}\right).
\label{pz_gauss}
\end{equation}

\cont{Overview of the code comparison. How the codes used for comparison were selected. Validation plots for several observables.}

Our goal is for outputs of \ccl to be validated against the results of a code-comparison project run within LSST-DESC down to a $10^{-4}$ or pre-established accuracy level if possible. In some cases, this level of accuracy is not necessary, as other systematics which have not yet been considered in this version of \ccl are expected to have a larger fractional impact. In the cases where this applies, we make it clear below.


A code comparison project was carried out among members of TJP where the following outputs of cosmological forecast codes were compared and validated:
\begin{enumerate}
\item growth factor at $z = 0,1,2,3,4,5$,
\item comoving radial distance $[$Mpc$/h]$ at the same redshifts, as well as the corresponding distance moduli,
\item linear matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, from BBKS \citep{BBKS} in units of $($Mpc$/h)^3$ at $z=0,2$ in the range $10^{-3} \leq k \leq 10 h/$Mpc with 10 bins per decade,
\item Eisenstein \& Hu matter power spectrum in units of $($Mpc$/h)^3$ at $z=0$ in the range $10^{-3} \leq k \leq 10 h/$Mpc with 10 bins per decade, and
\item the mass variance at $z=0$, $\sigma(M,z=0)$ for $M =\{10^6, 10^8, 10^{10}, 10^{12}, 10^{14}, 10^{16}\} $M$_\odot/h$.
\end{enumerate}
These predictions were produced and compared for different cosmologies, which are listed in the table below. The results agree to better than $0.1\%$ relative accuracy for comoving distance and growth factor among all submissions, and for $P(k)$ and $\sigma(M)$ among codes which use the same BBKS conventions.

We noticed that there are 2 typographical errors for the BBKS transfer function in ``Modern Cosmology'' \citep{DodelsonBook} compared to the original BBKS paper. The quadratic term should be $(16.1q)^2$ and the cubic term should be $(5.46q)^3$. The BBKS equation is correct in \citet{PeacockBook}. Using the wrong equation can give differences in the results above the $10^{-4}$ level.

In a second stage, we used the BBKS linear matter power spectrum from the previous step to compare two-point statistics for two redshift bins, resulting in three tomography combinations, ($1-1$),($1-2$),($2-2$). We computed the following quantities:
\begin{itemize}
\item projected galaxy clustering tomography power spectra: density term only (no magnification, RSD, etc.) with non-evolving linear bias $b(z) = 1$, in the range $10 < \ell < 10000$, using $5$ bins per decade,
\item angular convergence tomography power spectra: leading order convergence term only (no magnification), in the same range and with the same resolution as the case above,
\item angular galaxy clustering tomography correlation function, in the range $0.01 \deg < \theta < 5 \deg$, using 5 bins per decade, and
\item angular shear tomography correlation functions ($\xi_+$,$\xi_-$), similarly to above.
\end{itemize}
We adopted the following analytic redshift distributions: a Gaussian with $\sigma = 0.15$, centered at $z_1 = 1$; and another Gaussian with the same dispersion but centered at $z_2 = 1.5$. We repeated the exercise for two redshift distribution histograms shown in Figure \ref{fig:zhistos}.

%------------------------
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{zdist.eps}
\caption{Binned redshift distributions used for code comparison project.}
\label{fig:zhistos}
\end{figure}
%------------------------

In this second step, only 2 codes have been compared so far. More outputs are needed to guarantee convergence. From these outputs, we have concluded that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The cross-correlation between bins is particularly sensitive to the number of points where the kernels have been sampled.
\item The accuracy of the correlation function is sensitive to $\ell_{\rm max}$. We had to use up to $\ell_{\rm max}=3\times10^4$ for convergence (and we could not achieve $0.01\%$ convergence).
\item The large scales of the correlation function are sensitive to $\ell_{\rm min}$. The use of the flat-sky approximation is also relevant on these scales.
\item For sufficiently high precision, the correlation functions are sensitive to how the power spectrum is sampled and interpolated.
\end{itemize}

For $C_\ell$ computations, we required the relative difference between \ccl and the benchmarks to be $<10^{-3}$. We performed the test both for analytic redshift distributions and histograms.

To obtain realistic targets for the convergence of correlation function computations for LSST analyses, we calculate the expected statistical uncertainty of the clustering and lensing correlation functions of the LSST gold sample (c.f. Sect.~\damonge{missing section}),%\ref{sec:specs}
assuming an effective source galaxy density of $n_\mathrm{eff} = 26\mathrm{gal/sq\,arcmin}$ for galaxy shape distortions, and galaxy density of $n_\mathrm{gold} = 45\mathrm{gal/sq\,arcmin}$ for number counts. Specifically, we calculate the Gaussian covariance of angular correlation functions following the formalism of \citet{2008A&A...477...43J}, and note that leaving out the non-Gaussian covariance terms makes this convergence criterion more conservative. We split the galaxy samples into 10 tomography bins, defined to contain equal numbers of galaxies. The accuracy test then proceeds as follows. We compared the difference between \ccl calculated lensing and clustering correlations and the benchmarks for the analytic redshift distributions and for auto-correlations of redshift bins only. To pass the benchmark test, we required that this difference be smaller than half of the value of the errorbar derived from the covariance for each correlation function computed. Specifically, we take the value of the covariance in the bins centered at $z=1$ and $z=1.5$ to compare to the benchmarks.


The 3-dimensional correlation function $\xi(r)$ was validated by comparing with an independent transform code based
on the method of \cite{Ogata2005} implemented in the hankel.py python package. We calculate $\xi(r)$ by transforming the CCL
BBKS linear power spectrum using this independent code and using a fine sampling of $P(k)$. This is done for the five cosmologies
listed in Table~\ref{tab:cosmologies} and redshifts $z = 0,1,2,3,4,5$.  We then compare with the $\xi(r)$ from CCL with a sampling of $P(k)$
equal to {\tt N$\_$K$\_$3DCOR} bins per decade. The default value of {\tt N$\_$K$\_$3DCOR}~=~1000 results in fractional agreement
at the level of $<4 \times 10^{-3}$ for $0.1 < r < 50$~Mpc increasing to  $< 0.01 $ at $r = 100$~Mpc. Above this scale $\xi(r)$
approaches zero. If higher accuracy is desired, the user can increase the value of {\tt N$\_$K$\_$3DCOR}.


Additionally, independent codes were utilized to test the accuracy of halo mass function predictions. For the halo mass function, we compare the value of $\sigma$, $\log(\sigma^{-1})$, and the value of the halo mass function in the form used in \cite{Tinker2008},
\begin{equation}
\log[(M^2/\bar{\rho}_m)dn/dM].
\end{equation}
We note that while we maintain the $10^{-4}$ for our evaluations of $\sigma$, the accuracy degrades to a value of $5\times10^{-3}$ for the halo mass function evaluation, primarily at the high halo mass and high redshift domains. We find that this increased error is acceptable, as the level of precision is significantly better than the accuracy of current halo mass function models.

\subsection{Validation of the power spectrum over parameter space}
\vol{Phil Bull}

\cont{ `Fair' sampling of parameter space with Latin Hypercubes. Summary statistics used, and binning of power spectrum in $k$ and $z$. Precision settings used for CLASS. Estimates of run-time. Results. Range of validity.}

While concentrating on individual points in cosmological parameter space allows us to perform detailed validation tests, as above, it is important for \ccl to also be validated across a wide range of cosmological parameter values, e.g. to ensure validity for MCMC analyses. In this section, we present a set of validation tests for the \ccl linear and non-linear matter power spectrum functions that spans a broad rnage of $\Lambda$CDM parameters.

Covering a full range of all 5 $\Lambda$CDM parameters on a regular grid would be prohibitively expensive, so an alternative method for fairly (but more sparsely) sampling the parameter space is needed. We use Latin Hypercube Sampling to determine a tractably-sized set of sample points. This splits the parameter space into a regular grid with a given number of cells per dimension. The sample points are then chosen by going through each dimension in turn and choosing a cell at random {\it without replacement}, so that a given cell of a given dimension is only ever chosen once. This is repeated until all cells in all dimensions contain a single sample. This has the effect of covering the space uniformly but sparsely. The exact location of the sample within each cell can be chosen from a uniform distribution within that cell, but for simplicity we put each sample at the cell centre. The ranges used for each parameter are shown in Table~\ref{tab:paramranges}.

\end{table}


For each set of parameters, we then calculate the linear and non-linear power spectra using \ccl for a range of redshifts ($z \in \{ 0.0,\, 0.5,\, 1.0,\, 1.5,\, 2.0,\, 2.5\}$) and wavenumbers ($k \in [10^{-4}, 10^0]$ Mpc$^{-1}$). A corresponding set of reference power spectra is then produced using CLASS, which we run with settings chosen to produce high-precision results, taken from the {\tt pk\_ref.pre} precision file that is bundled with CLASS.

To quantify the level of agreement between the \ccl and reference power spectra, we use the following summary statistic that can be summed over a chosen set of bins in redshift and wavenumber:
\begin{equation}
\Delta = \sum_{ij} \Theta \left ( \log_{10} \left | \frac{P_{\rm CCL}(k_i, z_j) - P_{\rm ref}(k_i, z_j)}{P_{\rm ref}(k_i, z_j) \Delta_{\rm thres}} \right | \right ).
\end{equation}
Here, $\Delta_{\rm thres}$ is a target threshold for the fractional deviation between the power spectra, and we have defined $\Theta(x) \equiv x ~~(x \ge 0)$ and $0$ otherwise. Bins where the \ccl power spectrum deviates from the reference power spectrum by a fraction less than $\Delta_{\rm thres}$ do not contribute to the statistic, so the aim is to have $\Delta = 0$ (i.e. no deviation beyond the threshold in any bin). If deviations are found, however, they are weighted logarithmically -- one large deviation of several orders of magnitude affects the statistic as much as a few smaller deviations of order $\sim \Delta_{\rm thres}$.

\subsection{Validation of the Cosmic Emulator}
\vol{Elisa Chisari}

\citet{Lawrence17} quantified the accuracy of the matter power spectrum from their emulation scheme by comparing their predictions to the resulting power spectra from the numerical simulations used for the calibration of their scheme. We repeated this procedure making the emulator predictions via \ccl for a subset of emulator cosmologies. For cosmologies without neutrinos, we required the matter power spectrum at $z=0$ to be within $1\%$ of the smoothed simulated power spectrum from \citet{Lawrence17} (see their Figure 6). Similarly, we required $3\%$ accuracy for cosmologies with neutrinos (their Figure 5).

\section{Outlook}
\vol{David Alonso, Elisabeth Krause}
Science software development to facilitate the cosmological inference from LSST data is one of the critical task of the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC). Recent cosmological analyses of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) relied on CosmoSIS \citep{Zuntz14} and CosmoLike \citep{krause17}, the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) uses CosmoMC \citep{Lewis10}; all three frameworks employ CLASS, Camb, or the cosmic emulator to compute the density power spectra. Compared to the analyses of DES, KiDS and the Hyper-Suprime Cam Survey (HSC), future data sets (LSST, Euclid, WFIRST, etc) have substantially higher demands on analysis frameworks: The analyses are becoming more complex in terms of cosmological physics that is included in the analyses (neutrinos, modified gravity, and dark matter models) and in terms of modeling astrophysical and observational systematics at the required precision. 

It is the primary goal of the \ccl to become the backbone of all cosmological analyses carried out by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration of the LSST. This unified approach of a validated \ccl will ensure that DESC results that are both consistent (in that they will all be based on the same theory framework) and accurate (in that this framework has undergone a rigorous numerical validation).

The implementation of \ccl in realistic analysis pipelines has already begun: all likelihood module prototypes under development use it as its backbone, and the first of this, corresponding to the cosmological analysis of angular galaxy clustering cross-correlations, will serve as a model for the design of the joint-probes likelihood of the DESC \damonge{TJPCosmo-ers should feel free to strike this whole sentence out and rephrase as necessary!}. This work has allowed us to validate the performance of \ccl in a realistic analysis scenario, verifying its accuracy and efficiency in the context of computationally demanding MCMC runs. In addition to simulated analysis tests, \ccl has also been validated through its use in the analysis of current datasets \damonge{Do we know external papers that have used CCL?}

Beyond its usefulness in the DESC, the generality of the design envisioned for \ccl also aims to make it a useful tool for the analysis of other cosmological datasets, as well as for the cross-correlation of different experiments. To this end, and to allow a generic and flexible analysis of the LSST data, further functionality will be added to \ccl. Plans are in place to extend the range of standard and non-standard cosmological models covered by the code. Work is already underway to add a comprehensive implementation of the halo-model calculation of two-point functions \citep{Peacock2000} with sufficient flexibility to include generic parametrizations of observable halo profiles and mass-observable relations. The current simplified treatment of the galaxy-matter connection for galaxy clustering and intrinsic alignments will be improved by implementing generic perturbation-theory approaches to structure formation \citep{2009JCAP...08..020M,2016JCAP...09..015M}. A more complete implementation of all relevant cross-correlations between large-scale structure observables and other cosmological probes (e.g. CMB integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect \citep{1967ApJ...147...73S} and other secondary anisotropies) will also soon be included.

In general, although this document presents the functionality and performance of \ccl shortly after its release, we expect the library to be a continuously evolving piece of software. This will allow \ccl to satisfy the analysis needs of future large datasets, as well as more accurate and sophisticated models for a broad range of cosmological and astrophysical observables.

%Previous discussion on correlation functions
In this section we describe the computation of correlation functions given the angular power
spectrum.

We begin by briefly deriving the relation between correlation functions and power spectra.
A (scalar) angular space observable, $X$, with spin $s$ can be decompsed into spin spherical
harmonics
\begin{align}\label{eq:X_harmonic}
  X(\vec \Omega)=&\sum_{\ell m}\tilde X_{\ell m} {\hspace{5pt}}_sY_{\ell m}(\vec \Omega)
\end{align}
where $\vec \Omega$ refers to the angular coordinates on the sky.
The angular cross correlation function of two tracers, $X$ and $Z$ of the large scale
structure can be written in terms of their harmonic components, $\tilde X_{\ell m}$ and $\tilde Z_{\ell' m'}$ as
\begin{align}
  \langle XZ \rangle(\theta)=&\left\langle\sum_{\ell,m}\sum_{\ell', m'}\tilde X_{\ell m}\tilde
  Z_{\ell' m'}{\hspace{5pt}}_{s_X}Y_{\ell m}(\vec \Omega){\hspace{5pt}}_{s_Z}Y_{\ell'm'}(\vec \Omega+\theta)\right\rangle\\
  =&\sum_{\ell,m}C_{\ell}{\hspace{5pt}}_{s_X}Y_{\ell m}(\vec \Omega){\hspace{5pt}}_{s_Z}Y_{\ell m}(\vec \Omega+\theta)%\\
  %\langle XZ
  %\rangle(\theta)=&\frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\ell}(2\ell+1)C_{\ell}P_{\ell}(\cos\theta)\label{eq:xi_pl0}
\end{align}
where $s_X$ and $s_Z$ are the spins of tracers, $_{s}Y_{\ell m}$ are spin spherical harmonics and
we also used the identity
\begin{align}
  \langle\tilde X_{\ell m}\tilde Z_{\ell' m'}\rangle=&C_{\ell}\delta_D(m,m')\delta_D(\ell,\ell'),
  % \\
  % \sum_{m=-\ell}^{m=\ell}Y_{\ell m}(\vec\Omega)Y_{\ell m}(\vec\Omega+\theta)=&\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}
  % P_{\ell}(\cos\theta)
  % \label{eq:Ylm_Pl}.
\end{align}
Using the addition theorem for spin spherical harmonics and the relation between spherical
harmonics and wigner D-matrices\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_D-matrix}}
\citep{Ng1999}, we can write
\begin{align}
  \langle XZ
  \rangle(\theta)=&\frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\ell}(2\ell+1)C_{\ell}D^{\ell}_{s_X,-s_Z}(0,\theta,0)
\end{align}

The galaxy number count is spin zero and shear is a spin-2 object. Thus the expressions for various auto and cross correlations are \todo{expand to full width of page}
\begin{align}
  \xi_{gg}(\theta)&=\frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\ell}{(2\ell+1)}C_{\ell}^{gg}D^{\ell}_{0,0}(0,\theta,0)=
  \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\ell}{(2\ell+1)}C_{\ell}^{gg}P_{\ell}(\cos\theta)\label{eq:xi_gg_D}\\
  \langle g\gamma_T\rangle(\theta)&=
  \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\ell}{(2\ell+1)}C_{\ell}^{g\gamma}D^{\ell}_{2,0}(0,\theta,0)=
  \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\ell}(2\ell+1)\sqrt{\frac{(\ell-2)!}{(\ell+2)!}}C_{\ell}^{g\gamma}
  P_{\ell}^2(\cos\theta)\label{eq:xi_g_gamma_D}\\
  \langle g\kappa\rangle(\theta)&=
  \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\ell}{(2\ell+1)}C_{\ell}^{g\kappa}D^{\ell}_{0,0}(0,\theta,0)=
  \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\ell}(2\ell+1)C_{\ell}^{g\kappa}
  P_{\ell}(\cos\theta)\label{eq:xi_g_kappa_D}\\
  \xi_+(\theta)&=\frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\ell}{(2\ell+1)}C_{\ell}^{\gamma\gamma*}
  D^{\ell}_{2,2}(0,\theta,0)\label{eq:xi_p_D}\\
  \xi_-(\theta)&=\frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\ell}{(2\ell+1)}C_{\ell}^{\gamma\gamma*}
  D^{\ell}_{2,-2}(0,\theta,0)
  %\approx \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\ell}{(2\ell+1)}C_{\ell}^{\gamma\gamma*}P_{\ell}(\cos\theta)
  \label{eq:xi_m_D}
\end{align}

Using relations from \cite{Kilbinger2017}, we can write
\begin{align}
  C_{\ell}^{g\kappa}&={\frac{1}{2}\frac{(\ell+1)!}{(\ell-1)!}}C_{\ell}^{g\psi}\\
  C_{\ell}^{g\gamma}&=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{(\ell+2)!}{(\ell-2)!}}C_{\ell}^{g\psi}
  \\ \langle g\gamma_T\rangle(\theta)&
  =\frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\ell}\frac{(2\ell+1)}{\ell(\ell+1)}C_{\ell}^{g\kappa}P_{\ell}^2(\cos\theta)
  \label{eq:xi_g_gamma}\,.
\end{align}

The {\tt ccl\_tracer\_corr\_legendre} routine computes these transform to convert angular power
spectra, $C_\ell$, into correlation functions. We use the associated Legendre function
implementation from the {\tt GSL} library. {\tt ccl\_tracer\_corr\_legendre} routine evaluations
can be very slow, especially for polynomials $P_\ell^m$ with $m>0$. Note that the $P_\ell^m$
evaluations need to be done only once and can then be saved as long as $\ell$ and $\theta$ values
do not change. However, \ccl has not yet implemented this feature.

The {\tt ccl\_tracer\_corr\_legendre} methods currently does not support the computation of the shear correlation functions $\xi_{\pm}$, and the approximate {\tt ccl\_tracer\_corr\_fftlog} (described below) should be used instead. As demonstrated in \cite{Kilbinger2017} and \cite{Kitching17}, this approximation should be sufficient even for futuristic surveys.

\paragraph{Hankel Transform}
Notice that in the flat-sky limit, the expressions in Eqs.~\ref{eq:xi_gg_D}--\ref{eq:xi_m_D} can be
written as Hankel transforms using the relation between $D_{m,m'}^\ell$ and the Bessel functions $J$
(for $\ell\gg m,m'$)
\begin{align}
  D^{l}_{m,m'}(0,\theta,0)\approx J_{m-m'}(\ell\theta)
\end{align}
The same expressions can also be derived from Eqs.~\ref{eq:xi_p_D}--\ref{eq:xi_m_D} using the relation between $P_{\ell}^m$ and the Bessel functions $J_m$
\citep{Putter2010}
\begin{align}
  P_{\ell}^m(\cos\theta)=(-1)^m\frac{(\ell+m)!}{(\ell-m)!}\ell^{-m}J_m(\ell\theta)
\end{align}
which yields final expressions that coincide with Eq. \ref{eq:xipxim}.

For numerical integration to get (projected) correlation functions using Hankel transform,
we make use of the
public code {\tt FFTlog}\footnote{\url{http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog/}}
\citep{Hamilton2000,Talman2009}. In brief, {\tt FFTlog} works on functions periodic in log space,
by writing the Hankel Transform as a convolution between Bessel functions and the function of
interest (in this case $C_\ell$). A version of this code is included in \ccl with minor
modifications.
